# Hazard Detection Project using Machine Learning and NLP

## Project Description
This project aims to identify and categorize potential hazards in various environments using advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing textual data and environmental parameters, we develop models capable of detecting subtle indicators of hazards, thereby contributing to safer working and living environments.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilizes NLP techniques to clean and prepare textual data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Implements ML algorithms to train models on a comprehensive dataset of known hazards.
- **Hazard Detection**: Offers real-time hazard detection and categorization based on environmental data and textual descriptions.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple interface for inputting data and receiving hazard assessments.
